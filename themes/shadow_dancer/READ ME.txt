Yii Theme - Shadow Dancer - User Guide

Theming is a systematic way of customizing the outlook of pages in a Web application. By applying a new theme, the overall appearance of a Web application can be changed instantly and dramatically.

In Yii, each theme is represented as a directory consisting of view files, layout files, and relevant resource files such as images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. The name of a theme is its directory name. All themes reside under the same directory WebRoot/themes. At any time, only one theme can be active.
Installation

To install the theme extract it and copy it to the WebRoot/themes folder in your document root.
Configuring the theme

You need to add the following in your application configuration file

return array(      
  'theme'=>'shadow_dancer',      
  ......  
  );

Customizing your widgets globally

Note: this feature has been available since version 1.1.3.

Using the global widget customization feature, we only need to specify the css classes we want to use in a single place, i.e., the application configuration. This makes the customization of widgets more manageable.

To use the global widget customization feature, we need to configure the widgetFactory as follows:

  return array(
    'components'=>array(
		//copy from here
        'widgetFactory'=>array(
            'widgets'=>array(
                'CGridView'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('cellspacing'=>'0','cellpadding'=>'0'),
					'itemsCssClass'=>'item-class',
					'pagerCssClass'=>'pager-class'
                ),
                'CJuiTabs'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowtabs'),
                ),
                'CJuiAccordion'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowaccordion'),
                ),
                'CJuiProgressBar'=>array(
                   'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowprogressbar'),
                ),
                'CJuiSlider'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowslider'),
                ),
                'CJuiSliderInput'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowslider'),
                ),
                'CJuiButton'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowbutton'),
                ),
                'CJuiButton'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'shadowbutton'),
                ),
                'CJuiButton'=>array(
                    'htmlOptions'=>array('class'=>'button green'),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
  

Please note that in Yii versions prior to 1.1.3, you need to use the following configuration to enable widget skinning:

return array(
    'components'=>array(
        'widgetFactory'=>array(
            'class'=>'CWidgetFactory',
        ),
    ),
);
